# The URL to be used for remote drivers (including a selenium grid hub)
#webdriver.remote.url=

# What port to run PhantomJS on (used in conjunction with webdriver.remote.url to register with a Selenium hub,
# e.g. -Dphantomjs.webdriver=5555 -Dwebdriver.remote.url=http://localhost:4444
#phantomjs.webdriver.port=

# The driver to be used for remote drivers
#webdriver.remote.driver=

# How long webdriver waits for elements to appear by default, in milliseconds.
webdriver.timeouts.implicitlywait=5000

# The home directory for Thucydides output and data files - by default, $USER_HOME/.thucydides
#thucycides.home=

# Where should reports be generated.

# Should Thucydides only store screenshots for failing steps? This can save disk space and speed up the tests a little.
# It is very useful for data-driven testing. This property is now deprecated. Use thucycides.take.screenshots instead.
#serenity.only.save.failing.screenshots=true
thucycides.take.screenshots=true
# Should Thucydides take screenshots for every clicked button and every selected link?
# By default, a screenshot will be stored at the start and end of each step.
# If this option is set to true, Thucydides will record screenshots for any action performed on a WebElementFacade,
# i.e. any time you use an expression like element(�).click(), findBy(�).click() and so on.
# This will be overridden if the ONLY_SAVE_FAILING_SCREENSHOTS option is set to true.
# @Deprecated This property is still supported, but thucycides.take.screenshots provides more fine-grained control.
#thucycides.verbose.screenshots=

# Set this property to have more finer control on how screenshots are taken. This property can take the folowing values:
#    FOR_EACH_ACTION : Similar to thucycides.verbose.screenshots
#    BEFORE_AND_AFTER_EACH_STEP,
#    AFTER_EACH_STEP, and
#    FOR_FAILURES: Similar to thucycides.only.save.failing.screenshots

# Report on releases.
#thucycides.report.show.releases=

# During data-driven tests, some browsers (Firefox in particular) may slow down over time due to memory leaks.
# To get around this, you can get Thucydides to start a new browser session at regular intervals when it executes data-driven tests.
#thucycides.restart.browser.frequency=

# Pause (in ms) between each test step.

# Useful if you are running Firefox tests against an HTTPS test server without a valid certificate.

# Defines batch strategy. Allowed values - DIVIDE_EQUALLY (default) and DIVIDE_BY_TEST_COUNT.
# DIVIDE_EQUALLY will simply divide the tests equally across all batches.
# This could be inefficient if the number of tests vary a lot between test classes.
# A DIVIDE_BY_TEST_COUNT strategy could be more useful in such cases as this will create batches based on number of tests.
serenity.batch.strategy=DIVIDE_BY_TEST_COUNT

# If batch testing is being used, this is the size of the batches being executed.

# If batch testing is being used, this is the number of the batch being run on this machine.

# By default, Thucydides uses a custom locator factory called DisplayedElementLocatorFactory.
#thucycides.locator.factory=

# A set of user-defined capabilities to be used to configure the WebDriver driver. Capabilities should be passed in
# as a semi-colon-separated list of key:value pairs, e.g. "build:build-1234; max-duration:300; single-window:true; tags:[tag1,tag2,tag3]"
#thucycides.driver.capabilities=

# Activate and deactivate native events for Firefox by setting this property to true or false.
#thucycides.native.events=

# Set this to true to enable Java support in Firefox. By default, this is set to false as it slows down the web driver.
#security.enable_java=

# The base folder of the sub-module where the jBehave stories are kept. It is assumed that this directory contains sub
# folders src/test/resources. If this property is set, the requirements are read from src/test/resources under this
# folder instead of the classpath or working directory. This property is used to support situations where your working
# directory is different from the requirements base dir (for example when building a multi-module project from parent
# pom with requirements stored inside a sub-module)

# HTTP Proxy password configuration for Firefox and PhantomJS

# Arguments to be passed to the Chrome driver, separated by commas.

# The path to the directory of the profile to use when starting firefox. This defaults to webdriver creating an anonymous profile.
# This is useful if you want to run the web tests using your own Firefox profile.
# If you are not sure about how to find the path to your profile, look here: http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Profiles.
# For example, to run the default profile on a Mac OS X system, you would do something like this:
#webdriver.firefox.profile=

# A semicolon separated list of Firefox configuration settings. For ex.,
# -Dfirefox.preferences="browser.download.folderList=2;browser.download.manager.showWhenStarting=false;browser.download.dir=c:\downloads"

# The directory in which build history summary data is stored for each project.
# Each project has it�s own sub-folder within this directory. Defaults to ~./thucycides.
